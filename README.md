# Encryption-and-decryption-tool
Developed a Python-based GUI application for encrypting and decrypting text and files using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The tool allows users to securely encode/decode messages with a customizable shift key (1-25) and supports both direct text input and file processing (.txt and .docx formats).
